# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Monte Carlo Simulation of the game Craps. The goal is to use Numpy for a significantly faster run time than pure Python.

Both solutions here give a 49.2% chance of winning. Over 1 million iterations, the craps_masked function takes 1.8 seconds to run while the craps_optimzed function takes .16 seconds. This gives an 11x speed increase from craps_masked to craps_optimized.
